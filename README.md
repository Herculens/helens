# Lens equation solver accelerated by `JAX`

Lens equation solver for strong lensing applications, written in JAX (automatic differentiation, JIT-compilation, GPU support). Originally developped by [@austinpeel](https://github.com/austinpeel) as part of the lens modeling code [`Herculens`](https://github.com/austinpeel/herculens).
